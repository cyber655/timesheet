# Working hours timesheet

Of course there are many "todos" in this project.  
But it's main purpose is to create a timesheet with my working hours as a PDF document.
This application is written with Vue.js version 2.6.xx.

## Todos:

1. Implement a backend in the future or move to electron
2. Use TypeScript instead of pure JavaScript
3. Write much (more) unit tests especially for the store and the helper.
4. More cleaner SCSS segmentation and more reusable variables
5. More cleaner PDF creation code  

## Some special project characteristics:

1. This project is using a modular vuex-store to gain a better overview
2. I edited the open source library v-calendar library to fit my needs.
